# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

#  before yesterday.

    #  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

# TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

    formatted_article = [f"Headline: {article['title']} \nBrief: {article['description']}" for article in news_top]
    print(formatted_article)

# TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.


# Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
"""
